# CPP-Notes

do-while loop:
```cpp
do {
  /* statements; */
} while (/* condition */);
```
Note: There is semicolon (;) after while().

Characters and Strings:
- Character literal is enclosed in single quotes. Ex., 'h'.  
- String literal is enclosed in double quotes, Ex., "harry".

Note: Size of int datatype depends on system architecture. In most modern system architecture, int has minimum size of 4 bytes. 
Generally, short has half of the size of int and long has two-times the size of int.

Note: Size of float datatype depends on system architecture. In most modern system architecture, float has minimum size of 4 bytes. 
Generally, double has two-times the size of float and long double has two-times or four-times the size of float.

**floats are always signed.**

Characters:
A char variable holds a 1-byte integer. However, instead of interpreting the value of the char as an integer, the value of a char variable is typically interpreted as an ASCII character.

If a boolean value is assigned to an integer, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.
If an integer value is assigned to a Boolean, 0 becomes false and any value that has a non-zero value becomes true.
